# VQS simulations
Simulation in python of VQS methods. We will introduce the different functions implemented for our calculus.

* For taking the data of measurements use file `measures/data_measuring.ipynb`.
* For measurement plots `measures/plot_script.ipynb`

* For the DG or RED data use the file `results/data_results.ipynb`.
* For DG/RED plots `results/plot_script.ipynb`

## DG algorithm 
Implementation of *descent gradient* algorithm.

## RED algorithm 
Implementation of *random estimation descent* algorithm.

## Multimeasure algorithm
Implementation classically of the quantum probabilistic measurement.

## Quantum circuit simulation
Implementation of the quantum circuit.

## Data generation
All methods toether to extract data.

## Hamiltonian definition
We create a script with all the hamiltonians needed.
